# Proof of Concept Sptfy Recorder

## Warning 
Using the API in this manner might conflict with the terms of use

In Germany, creating a private copy is allowed, still there might be a conflict with the Spotify terms of use.

**Use at your own risk**

## What it does

This is a simple PoC to demonstrate 
- controlling Spotify playback trhough the Spotify API (play all tracks of a certain playlist one by one).
- creating a loopback recording through the local soundcard.
- encoding the recording as MP3.
- setting relevant MP3 tags with the title information from Spotify.

This is something I wanted to try for a long time already. Whenever my kids wanted to listen to anything on their own mp3-player.
